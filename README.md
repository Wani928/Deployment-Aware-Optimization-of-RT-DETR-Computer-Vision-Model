# Deployment-Aware-Optimization-of-RT-DETR-Computer-Vision-Model
Deployment-aware analysis of RT-DETR, studying how the number of object queries affects accuracy (mAP), inference latency, and energy consumption. Uses multi-objective optimization to identify optimal trade-offs for resource-constrained platforms.
